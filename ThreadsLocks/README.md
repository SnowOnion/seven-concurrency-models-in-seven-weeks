How to run these example programs with IntelliJ IDEA at 2016-12-16?

I created an IntelliJ IDEA project on `ThreadsLocks/`,

dragged every `pom.xml` to "Maven Projects" tool window (select them all and drag all at once),

and used IDEA's `Run - Run...` (alt+shift+F10 in Windows) to run each program (instead of running them via Maven).
